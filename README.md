# Highway dimension

This repository contains an implementation of an approximation algorithm for calculating highway dimension.
The algorithm is used to evaluate highway dimension of real world transportation networks.

## Project structure

Directory **src** contains the source code for highway dimension approximation.

Directory **data** contains weighted graph representation of studied networks.

Directory **gtfs-parser** contains a converter from GTFS format to weighted graph format.
